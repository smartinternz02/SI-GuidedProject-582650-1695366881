# Assignment 5

Take all the columns in `Mall_Customers.csv`:
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

Perform label encoding on Gender and train your data.

## Sections

The notebook consists of the following sections:

### Data Exploration and Visualization

Explore synthetic data with visualizations.

### Model Training and Visualization

Train a linear regression model and visualize the fitted line.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Data Preprocessing

Perform label encoding on the 'Gender' column.

### Handling Outliers

Detect and handle outliers in the data.

### Train-Test Split

Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Visualization

Train the model on the preprocessed data.

### Model Evaluation (Visualize Mean Squared Error and R-squared Score)

Evaluate the model using MSE and R-squared and visualize the results.

### Model Accuracy Visualization

Visualize the model's accuracy.

### Additional Visualizations

Visualize the distribution of data, outliers, and model performance.

## Results and Insights

The linear regression model achieves a perfect R-squared score of 1 in this synthetic dataset. However, such perfect results are rare in real-world scenarios due to data noise and complexity.

## Conclusion and Analysis

In this assignment, we explored a synthetic dataset and demonstrated a linear regression model's capabilities. While the model achieved a perfect score in this controlled environment, it's essential to remember that real-world data often presents challenges that may affect model performance.
