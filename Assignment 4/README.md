# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project aims to analyze employee attrition using the Employee Attrition Dataset from Kaggle. It involves data preprocessing, model building using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, and calculating performance metrics.

## Dataset

The Employee Attrition Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelprashant/employee-attrition). Make sure to place the downloaded dataset in the same directory as the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

The notebook performs various data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for model building. These steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Building

Two models are built in this project using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms. The notebook demonstrates how to train these models on the preprocessed dataset and make predictions.

## Performance Metrics

The notebook calculates performance metrics to evaluate the models' performance. Common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score may be used to assess the models' predictive capabilities.

## Requirements

To run the notebook successfully, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Running the Notebook

1. Download the Employee Attrition Dataset from the provided link.
2. Place the downloaded dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model building, and calculate performance metrics.

Feel free to explore and modify the notebook as needed. Happy coding!
